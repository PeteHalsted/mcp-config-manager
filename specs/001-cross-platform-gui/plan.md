7. Plan Phase 2 → Task generation approach defined
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
Develop a cross-platform GUI application for managing MCP server configurations across multiple AI systems (Claude, Gemini). The GUI will provide visual interfaces for server management, preset handling, and configuration synchronization, leveraging the existing Python CLI codebase for core functionality.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (matching existing codebase)  
**Primary Dependencies**: PyQt6 (primary), tkinter (fallback), existing core modules  
**Storage**: JSON files (~/.claude.json, ~/.gemini/settings.json, ~/.mcp_presets.json)  
**Testing**: pytest (existing), GUI testing framework TBD  
**Target Platform**: Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 20.04+  
**Project Type**: single (Desktop GUI application with library backend)  
**Performance Goals**: <100ms UI response time, instant config updates  
**Constraints**: <5 clicks for common workflows, zero data loss  
**Scale/Scope**: ~30 functional requirements, 5 main UI screens

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 2 (gui, tests) - leveraging existing src/mcp_config_manager library
- Using framework directly? Yes - PyQt6/tkinter without wrappers
- Single data model? Yes - reusing existing ConfigManager/ServerManager
- Avoiding patterns? Yes - direct integration with existing modules

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes - GUI consumes existing libraries
- Libraries listed: 
  - ConfigManager (config orchestration)
  - ServerManager (server enable/disable)
  - PresetManager (preset operations)
  - Parsers (Claude/Gemini config handling)
- CLI per library: Existing CLI maintained alongside GUI
- Library docs: Existing docs, will update with GUI integration

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Will enforce
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes - actual config files
- Integration tests for: GUI-library integration, config sync
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test understood

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes - existing logging infrastructure
- Frontend logs → backend? GUI logs to same system
- Error context sufficient? User-friendly dialogs with technical details

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? Will use existing version scheme
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes
- Breaking changes handled? GUI addition is non-breaking

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 - Single project structure for desktop GUI application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**:
   - GUI framework final selection (PyQt6 vs tkinter)
   - Cross-platform packaging strategy
   - GUI testing framework selection
   - Platform-specific UI conventions

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research PyQt6 vs tkinter for cross-platform desktop apps"
   Task: "Find best practices for Python GUI testing"
   Task: "Research cross-platform packaging (PyInstaller, cx_Freeze)"
   Task: "Investigate platform-specific UI guidelines"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`:
   - Framework decision with rationale
   - Packaging approach selection
   - Testing strategy definition
   - Platform adaptation guidelines

**Output**: research.md with framework decisions and implementation strategy

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - GUI State Model (current mode, unsaved changes, active view)
   - UI Configuration (theme, window size, shortcuts)
   - View Models for server list, preset list, settings

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Internal GUI-to-library contracts
   - Event handling contracts
   - State management contracts
   - Output to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - GUI initialization tests
   - Event handler tests
   - State transition tests
   - Tests must fail initially

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Server toggle workflow test
   - Preset load/save workflow test
   - Mode switching workflow test
   - Error recovery workflow test

5. **Update CLAUDE.md incrementally**:
   - Add GUI development instructions
   - Include testing commands
   - Document GUI architecture decisions

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- GUI framework setup and project structure
- Main window implementation with server list
- Dialog implementations (add server, presets, settings)
- Event handling and state management
- Integration with existing libraries
- Cross-platform testing
- Packaging and distribution setup

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Framework setup first
- Core UI components before dialogs
- Integration after UI skeleton
- Testing throughout (TDD)
- Packaging last

**Estimated Output**: 30-35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No violations - design maintains simplicity by reusing existing libraries*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none)
