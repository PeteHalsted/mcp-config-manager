# Feature Specification: Cross-Platform GUI for MCP Configuration Management

**Feature Branch**: `001-cross-platform-gui`  
**Created**: 2025-01-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Cross-platform GUI application for managing Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configurations across multiple AI systems"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Extracted: GUI app, MCP server configs, multi-AI system support
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Developers, Teams, Power Users
   → Actions: Toggle servers, Manage presets, Sync configs, Backup/restore
   → Data: Server configs, Presets, Settings
   → Constraints: Cross-platform, Zero data loss, <5 clicks workflows
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → All aspects clearly defined from problem statement
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → User flows defined for all primary workflows
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → All requirements testable and unambiguous
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Server Configuration, Preset, Backup identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   → All requirements clear, no implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer using AI assistants with MCP integrations, I want a graphical interface to manage my server configurations so that I can quickly enable/disable servers, switch between project presets, and avoid manually editing JSON files that could break my setup.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has multiple MCP servers configured, **When** they open the application, **Then** they see all servers listed with their current status (enabled/disabled) clearly indicated

2. **Given** a user wants to optimize context usage for a minimal setup, **When** they select the "minimal" preset, **Then** only essential servers are enabled and all others are disabled without losing their configurations

3. **Given** a user is switching between client projects, **When** they load a saved project preset, **Then** all server configurations including API keys and settings are restored to match that project's requirements

4. **Given** a user wants to add a new MCP server, **When** they paste valid JSON configuration, **Then** the server is added to their configuration and appears in the server list

5. **Given** a user makes changes to their configuration, **When** they save the changes, **Then** a backup is automatically created before applying changes

6. **Given** a user has both Claude and Gemini installed, **When** they toggle a server in "Both" mode, **Then** the change is synchronized across both AI systems

7. **Given** a configuration file becomes corrupted, **When** the user opens the application, **Then** they receive a clear error message with an option to restore from the most recent backup

### Edge Cases
- What happens when configuration files are missing? → Application offers to create default configurations or restore from backup
- How does system handle invalid JSON when adding servers? → Validation provides specific error messages about what's wrong with the JSON
- What if backup directory is full or write-protected? → User is warned and given option to save backup to alternative location
- How does application handle concurrent modifications? → Last-write-wins with clear indication of when config was last modified
- What happens when switching modes with unsaved changes? → User is prompted to save or discard changes before switching

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Configuration Management**
- **FR-001**: System MUST display all configured MCP servers with their current enabled/disabled status
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to toggle individual servers between enabled and disabled states
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve disabled server configurations when toggling off
- **FR-004**: System MUST support three operation modes: Claude-only, Gemini-only, and Both (synchronized)
- **FR-005**: System MUST synchronize server states between Claude and Gemini when in "Both" mode

**Preset Management**
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to save current configuration as a named preset
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to load previously saved presets
- **FR-008**: System MUST include built-in presets for common scenarios (minimal, web development, full stack)
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to delete and rename custom presets
- **FR-010**: System MUST show a preview of preset contents before applying

**Server Addition**
- **FR-011**: System MUST accept new server configurations via JSON paste
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate JSON structure before adding new servers
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide clear error messages for invalid JSON
- **FR-014**: System MUST prevent duplicate server additions

**Data Protection**
- **FR-015**: System MUST create automatic backups before any configuration changes
- **FR-016**: System MUST maintain at least 10 most recent backups
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide ability to restore from any available backup
- **FR-018**: System MUST validate configuration files on load and offer recovery options if corrupted

**User Interface**
- **FR-019**: System MUST complete common workflows in fewer than 5 user interactions
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide visual feedback for all state changes
- **FR-021**: System MUST display current mode (Claude/Gemini/Both) prominently
- **FR-022**: System MUST show unsaved changes indicator
- **FR-023**: System MUST provide keyboard shortcuts for common actions

**Cross-Platform Support**
- **FR-024**: System MUST run on Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, and Ubuntu 20.04+
- **FR-025**: System MUST adapt UI to platform conventions (native look and feel)
- **FR-026**: System MUST handle platform-specific file paths correctly

**Error Handling**
- **FR-027**: System MUST provide user-friendly error messages for all failure scenarios
- **FR-028**: System MUST never lose user data due to application errors
- **FR-029**: System MUST offer recovery suggestions for common problems
- **FR-030**: System MUST log errors for troubleshooting without exposing sensitive data

### Key Entities

- **Server Configuration**: Represents an MCP server with its settings, command, arguments, and environment variables. Can be in enabled or disabled state.

- **Preset**: A saved collection of server configurations with their states, representing a complete setup for a specific use case or project.

- **Backup**: A timestamped copy of the complete configuration state, used for recovery and rollback purposes.

- **Application Mode**: The current operating context (Claude-only, Gemini-only, or Both), determining which configuration files are read and modified.

- **User Preference**: Application-level settings such as theme, default mode, backup retention count, and UI preferences.
