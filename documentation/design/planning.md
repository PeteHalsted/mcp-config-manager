## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Design Principles
1. **Backwards Compatibility**: Never break existing workflows
2. **Data Safety**: Always backup before changes, never lose configurations
3. **Cross-Platform**: Work identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux
4. **Extensibility**: Architecture that supports future enhancements
5. **User-Centric**: Optimize for common workflows, minimize clicks

### Key Design Decisions

#### Configuration Storage Strategy
**Decision**: Separate disabled server storage
**Rationale**: 
- Preserves server configurations when disabled
- Allows quick enable/disable without data loss
- Maintains compatibility with Claude/Gemini expectations
- Enables advanced features like presets and templates

#### Multi-Client Support Approach
**Decision**: Synchronized multi-client management
**Rationale**:
- Users often work with both Claude and Gemini
- Synchronized configs reduce cognitive overhead
- Mode selection allows flexibility when needed
- Future-proofs for additional AI systems

#### GUI Framework Selection
**Current Decision**: PyQt6
**Rationale**:
- Professional appearance increases adoption
- Rich widget set supports advanced features
- Cross-platform consistency
- Strong community and documentation

**Fallback**: tkinter if deployment complexity becomes problematic

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

#### High Risk: Configuration Data Loss
**Risk**: User loses MCP server configurations due to bugs
**Mitigation**: 
- Automatic backups before all operations
- Comprehensive input validation
- Extensive testing with real configurations
- Easy restore functionality

#### Medium Risk: GUI Framework Complexity
**Risk**: PyQt6 deployment issues or learning curve
**Mitigation**:
- Start with simple interfaces, add complexity incrementally
- Maintain CLI as primary interface during GUI development
- Have tkinter fallback plan ready
- Thorough cross-platform testing

#### Low Risk: Performance with Large Configurations
**Risk**: Slow performance with many servers or large configs
**Mitigation**:
- Lazy loading for large server lists
- Background operations for health checking
- Efficient JSON parsing and caching
- Performance testing with realistic datasets
