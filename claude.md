# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MCP Config Manager is a cross-platform utility for managing Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configurations across Claude, Gemini, and other AI systems. Built from the battle-tested `mcp_toggle.py` script, now with modular architecture.

## Current Project: MCP Config Manager

### Active Specification
- **Spec**: `specs/001-cross-platform-gui/spec.md`
- **Plan**: `specs/001-cross-platform-gui/plan.md` 
- **Tasks**: `specs/001-cross-platform-gui/tasks.md`

### Implementation Status
- Current phase: Polish & Platform Testing (Phase 3.5)
- Active branch: master
- T068 Complete: macOS-specific platform testing implemented

## Current Status (Updated 2025-01-09)

### ✅ Phase 1 Complete: Core Functionality
- Interactive CLI interface (fully functional)
- Multi-client support (Claude + Gemini with syncing)
- Server enable/disable with separate storage
- Automatic configuration backups
- Preset management system
- JSON server addition by paste
- Command line interface for automation
- Configuration validation
- Cross-platform file handling

### ✅ Phase 2 Complete: GUI Development

#### ✅ Phase 3.1 Complete: Project Setup
- GUI module structure created at `src/gui/`
- PyQt6 dependencies configured with tkinter fallback
- pytest-qt testing framework configured
- Resource directories established
- GUI entry point configured in `__main__.py`

#### ✅ Phase 3.2 Complete: TDD Contract Tests (25/25 tasks)
**All tests written and intentionally failing with `ModuleNotFoundError`:**
- ✅ 14 Contract tests for GUI-Library integration (config, servers, presets, backups, validation)
- ✅ 5 Event contract tests (config, server, preset, app, UI events)
- ✅ 5 Integration tests covering complete user workflows:
  - `test_toggle_workflow.py` - Server enable/disable operations
  - `test_preset_workflow.py` - Preset management (list, apply, save, delete)
  - `test_add_server_workflow.py` - Adding servers via JSON paste
  - `test_mode_switch_workflow.py` - Mode switching and synchronization
  - `test_backup_workflow.py` - Backup creation and restoration

**Key Decisions Made:**
1. **Contract-First Development**: All 25 test files define exact API before implementation
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Tests expect loosely coupled event system
3. **Request/Response Pattern**: All operations follow `{success: bool, data/error: {...}}`

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **ConfigManager** (`core/config_manager.py`): Central orchestrator handling loading, saving, and syncing between Claude and Gemini configs. Primary API for both CLI and GUI.
- **ServerManager** (`core/server_manager.py`): Manages server enable/disable operations with separate storage for disabled servers.
- **PresetManager** (`core/presets.py`): Handles preset configurations in `~/.mcp_presets.json`.
- **Parsers** (`parsers/`): Claude and Gemini specific config file handling with validation.
- **GUI** (`gui/`): PyQt6/tkinter GUI components including main window, dialogs, and widgets.
- **Controllers** (`gui/controllers/`): GUI-library integration layer handling events and state.

### File Locations
- Claude config: `~/.claude.json`
- Gemini config: `~/.gemini/settings.json`
- Presets: `~/.mcp_presets.json`
- Disabled servers: `./disabled_servers.json` (in project directory)
- Backups: `~/.claude.json.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`

## Critical Implementation Notes

1. **Interactive Mode is the Gold Standard** - Test all changes against `mcp-config-manager interactive` as it contains the complete original functionality users rely on.

2. **Mode Support** - All operations must support mode parameter: 'claude', 'gemini', or 'both' (synced).

3. **Error Handling** - Always create backups before changes, handle JSON parsing gracefully, never lose user configurations.

4. **Backwards Compatibility** - Original `mcp_toggle.py` users must be able to migrate seamlessly.

## Current Implementation Details

### Interactive Mode Commands
- `[1-N]` - Disable active server by number
- `[d1-N]` - Enable disabled server by number
- `[a]` - Enable all servers
- `[n]` - Disable all servers
- `[m]` - Minimal preset (context7 + browsermcp)
- `[w]` - Web dev preset (+ playwright)
- `[+]` - Add new server (paste JSON)
- `[p]` - Preset management
- `[c]` - Change CLI mode
- `[s]` - Save and exit
- `[q]` - Quit without saving

### CLI Commands
- `interactive` - Launch full interactive mode
- `status` - Show current server status
- `enable/disable <server>` - Toggle specific servers
- `enable-all/disable-all` - Bulk operations
- `preset <mode>` - Apply preset modes
- `validate <file>` - Validate config files

## GUI Development (Phase 2)

### Framework Architecture Decisions
- **Primary**: PyQt6 for professional native appearance
- **Fallback**: tkinter for environments without Qt
- **Pattern**: Controller-based architecture with event system
- **Testing**: Contract-first TDD approach

### Contract Test Structure
The GUI implementation follows a strict contract-based architecture:

```
tests/test_gui/
├── contract/           # API contracts between GUI and library
│   ├── test_config_*.py    # Configuration operations
│   ├── test_servers_*.py   # Server management
│   ├── test_presets_*.py   # Preset operations
│   └── test_backups_*.py   # Backup/restore operations
├── events/            # Event system contracts
│   ├── test_config_events.py   # Configuration events
│   ├── test_server_events.py   # Server state events
│   ├── test_preset_events.py   # Preset events
│   ├── test_app_events.py      # Application lifecycle
│   └── test_ui_events.py       # UI interactions
└── integration/       # End-to-end workflows
    ├── test_toggle_workflow.py     # Server enable/disable operations
    ├── test_preset_workflow.py     # Preset management workflows
    ├── test_add_server_workflow.py # Adding servers via JSON
    ├── test_mode_switch_workflow.py # Mode switching and sync
    └── test_backup_workflow.py     # Backup and restore operations
```

### Key Implementation Decisions

1. **Contract-First Development**: All tests written before implementation, defining exact API
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loosely coupled components communicate via events
3. **Mode Abstraction**: GUI unaware of Claude/Gemini specifics, uses unified interface
4. **Request/Response Pattern**: All operations follow consistent request validation → execution → response format
5. **Error Handling**: Every operation returns `{success: bool, data/error: {...}}` structure
6. **Async Support**: Event system supports both sync and async handlers
7. **Rich Data Models**: Models include validation, filtering, state management, and serialization
8. **Type Safety**: Extensive use of Enums and type hints for reliability
9. **Separation of Concerns**: Each model handles its own validation and business logic
10. **Human-Readable Formatting**: Models provide user-friendly string representations (age, size, etc.)

### GUI Component Requirements
- Server list with enable/disable toggles
- Mode selection (Claude/Gemini/Both)
- Preset management interface

   - Delete custom presets
   - Mode synchronization

3. **test_add_server_workflow.py**: Server addition
   - JSON validation
   - Duplicate detection
   - Environment variable handling
   - Multi-mode support

4. **test_mode_switch_workflow.py**: Mode management
   - Switch between Claude/Gemini/Both
   - Configuration synchronization
   - Unsaved changes warnings
   - Mode-specific operations

5. **test_backup_workflow.py**: Backup operations
   - Create and restore backups
   - Automatic backup on save
   - Retention limits
   - Selective restoration
   - Metadata preservation

## Recent Implementation Progress (2025-01-09)

### Current Session 3: Server List Implementation & Backend Integration

#### Key Accomplishments:
1. **Fixed Server List Placeholder Issue**
   - Replaced "Server list will be implemented in T036" placeholder with actual ServerListWidget
   - The message was a leftover development task tracker (T036 was a task number)
   - Server list now properly displays for managing MCP servers (context7, browsermcp, playwright, etc.)

2. **GUI Launch Stabilization**
   - Fixed initialization order: UI components must be set up before loading configuration
   - Status bar, menus, and toolbar now initialized before config load
   - Proper event connection between server list and main window

#### Current Blockers - Missing Backend Methods:
The GUI launches successfully but cannot populate the server list due to missing backend implementations:

1. **ServerController.get_servers()** - Missing method
   - Needs to return: `{success: bool, data: {servers: List[ServerListItem]}}`
   - Should call ConfigManager to get both active and disabled servers
   - Must support mode parameter (claude/gemini/both)

2. **ServerManager.get_enabled_servers()** - Missing method  
   - Called by ConfigController's _get_server_list()
   - Should return list of enabled servers from configuration
   - Must handle both Claude and Gemini configs based on mode

3. **ServerListWidget.load_servers()** - Needs implementation
   - Should accept list of ServerListItem objects
   - Populate the QTreeWidget/tkinter tree with server data
   - Display columns: Enabled checkbox, Server name, Status, Mode

#### Key Decisions Made:
1. **Server List Purpose Clarified**
   - Displays MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers configured for AI tools
   - Allows visual enable/disable instead of command-line operations
   - Shows servers like context7, browsermcp, playwright, supabase, etc.

2. **Widget Integration Pattern**
   - Use actual widgets (ServerListWidget) not placeholders
   - Connect Qt signals for PyQt6, callbacks for tkinter
   - Controllers bridge between GUI widgets and core managers

3. **Initialization Sequence Critical**
   - UI setup → Menus → Toolbar → Status Bar → Events → Load Config
   - Cannot call UI methods before components are initialized
   - Event system must be connected before triggering events

#### Next Immediate Steps:
1. **Implement ServerController.get_servers()**
   - Bridge to ConfigManager.list_servers()
   - Format data as ServerListItem objects
   - Handle mode filtering

2. **Add ServerManager.get_enabled_servers()**
   - Parse mcpServers from configs
   - Return only active servers
   - Support claude/gemini/both modes

3. **Complete ServerListWidget.load_servers()**
   - Clear existing items
   - Add new items from server list
   - Set checkbox states based on enabled status

4. **Test Full Server Display**
   - Verify all 9 configured MCP servers appear
   - Test enable/disable toggles
   - Ensure persistence on save

#### Important Context for Future Sessions:
- Interactive CLI mode remains fully functional (primary interface)
- GUI framework detection working (PyQt6 primary, tkinter fallback)
- User has 9 active MCP servers configured that should display
- Config path issue resolved: use ConfigManager attributes not parser attributes
- Multiple background GUI processes may be running - check with ps/kill if needed

### Current Session 2: GUI Launch Fixes & Integration

#### Key Accomplishments:
1. **Fixed GUI Launch Issues**
   - Moved GUI files from incorrect `src/gui/` to proper `src/mcp_config_manager/gui/` location
   - Fixed PyQt6 imports (QAction now correctly imported from QtGui instead of QtWidgets)
   - Resolved type hint issues with ttk when PyQt6 is available
   - Fixed WindowGeometry object handling (using attributes instead of dict subscripting)
   - Added proper framework detection with HAS_TKINTER flag

2. **Fixed Controller-ConfigManager Integration**
   - Corrected method name mismatches:
     - `load_config` → `load_configs` (returns tuple of claude_data, gemini_data)
     - `save_config` → `save_configs` (requires claude_data, gemini_data, mode)
     - `create_backup` → `create_backups` (returns list of tuples)
   - Fixed Mode enum value handling (using `.value` when passing to methods)
   - Added proper sys import for QApplication initialization

3. **GUI Now Partially Functional**
   - PyQt6 window successfully launches
   - Application framework properly detected
   - Main window displays without crashing
   - Event system and controllers connected

#### Current Blockers:
1. **ClaudeConfigParser Missing Attribute**
   - Error: `'ClaudeConfigParser' object has no attribute 'config_path'`
   - ConfigController trying to access `config_path` attribute that doesn't exist
   - Need to check parser implementation for correct attribute name

#### Key Decisions Made:
1. **Import Handling Strategy**
   - When PyQt6 is available, set tkinter imports to None
   - Use conditional checks (USING_QT, HAS_TKINTER) throughout
   - Type hints use `Any` when framework-specific types unavailable

2. **API Alignment**
   - Controllers must match ConfigManager's actual API
   - ConfigManager uses plural forms (configs, not config)
   - Methods return specific data structures that controllers must handle

3. **File Structure Correction**
   - GUI files must be in `src/mcp_config_manager/gui/` not `src/gui/`
   - Maintains proper Python package structure
   - Ensures imports work correctly

#### Next Immediate Steps:
1. Fix the `config_path` attribute issue in ConfigController
2. Verify all parser attributes are correctly referenced
3. Test full GUI functionality once config loading works
4. Continue with remaining platform testing tasks

### Previous Session 1: macOS Platform Testing & GUI Launch (T068)

#### Key Accomplishments:
1. **T068 Complete** - Comprehensive macOS-specific platform testing implemented
   - File paths and permissions testing
   - GUI framework availability detection (PyQt6/tkinter)
   - macOS-specific keyboard shortcuts (Cmd vs Ctrl)
   - Native menu bar integration
   - Dark mode detection
   - Notification center integration
   - Retina display support
   - Application bundle structure validation

2. **GUI Framework Setup**
   - Successfully installed PyQt6 on macOS
   - Verified PyQt6 window can launch and display
   - Identified import handling issues in dialog modules

3. **Interactive Mode Verification**
   - Confirmed interactive CLI mode is fully functional
   - All 9 MCP servers properly configured and manageable
   - Backup system working correctly

#### Key Decisions Made:
1. **Import Strategy for Dual Framework Support**
   - Need to handle missing tkinter gracefully when PyQt6 is available
   - Set fallback objects to None when framework not available
   - Conditional imports pattern: try PyQt6 first, fallback to tkinter, handle neither

2. **Testing Approach**
   - Platform tests gracefully skip when GUI frameworks unavailable
   - Tests validate expected behavior without requiring actual GUI launch
   - Focus on platform-specific paths, conventions, and integrations

3. **ConfigMode Enum Addition**
   - Added ConfigMode enum to config_manager.py
   - Provides CLAUDE, GEMINI, BOTH modes for application state
   - Used throughout GUI controllers for mode management

#### Current Blockers:
1. **GUI Import Issues**
   - Dialog modules need consistent import handling for tkinter fallback
   - When PyQt6 is available, tkinter imports still attempted causing errors
   - Solution: Apply consistent conditional import pattern across all GUI files

#### Next Steps:
1. **Fix GUI Launch**
   - Apply consistent import pattern to all dialog files
   - Ensure tk/ttk/messagebox set to None when using PyQt6
   - Test full GUI launch with all dialogs functional

2. **Continue Platform Testing**
   - T067: Windows-specific testing
   - T069: Linux-specific testing

3. **Performance & Packaging**
   - T070-T073: Performance optimizations
   - T074-T077: Platform packaging with PyInstaller

#### Important Context for Future Sessions:
- Interactive mode is the primary interface and is fully functional
- PyQt6 is installed and working on macOS (verified with simple window test)
- Import handling needs standardization across all GUI modules
- All core functionality is complete and tested
- User has 9 active MCP servers configured

### Previous Session: Phase 3.4 Integration Complete (T053-T066)
Successfully implemented all integration tasks, completing the core GUI functionality:

#### Key Accomplishments:
1. **Library Integration** - Controllers properly connected to core managers (already in place)
2. **Advanced UI Features** - Search, filtering, multi-selection, drag-drop all functional
3. **Background Operations** - Thread-safe file operations with progress tracking
4. **Complete tkinter Support** - Full fallback implementation ensuring universal compatibility

#### Architecture Decisions from This Session:

1. **File Watching Strategy**
   - Separate FileWatcher base class for reusability
   - ConfigFileWatcher specialization for MCP configs
   - Thread-based monitoring with configurable intervals
   - Callback-based change notifications

2. **Search/Filter Implementation**
   - Debounced search to reduce UI updates (300ms delay)
   - Consistent filtering logic across frameworks
   - ServerFilter helper for centralized filter logic
   - Real-time updates without full list rebuilds

3. **Threading Architecture**
   - Task-based approach with BackgroundTask objects
   - Cancellation tokens for graceful shutdown
   - Progress tracking built into task system
   - Separate FileOperationWorker for config operations

4. **tkinter Parity Strategy**
   - Wrapper approach maintaining compatibility
   - Feature parity where possible
   - Graceful degradation for unsupported features
   - Consistent API across both frameworks

#### Key Insights:

1. **Controller Connection Efficiency**
   - Controllers were already properly connected to managers
   - Good separation of concerns maintained throughout
   - Event system provides clean integration points

2. **Thread Safety Importance**
   - RLock usage prevents deadlocks in reentrant scenarios
   - Batch operations benefit from lock optimization
   - State consistency maintained across threads

3. **Framework Abstraction Success**
   - Dual framework support working seamlessly

2. **All 4 Controllers Implemented** - Full business logic bridge between GUI and core library
3. **Consistent Architecture** - Request/response pattern across all controllers
4. **Event System Ready** - Callback registration in place for all major operations

#### Architecture Decisions from This Session:

1. **Dual Framework Consistency**
   - Every dialog works identically in PyQt6 and tkinter
   - Conditional imports with USING_QT flag maintained throughout
   - Visual parity achieved despite framework limitations

2. **Controller Pattern Success**
   - Clean separation between UI (dialogs) and logic (controllers)
   - Controllers directly integrate with existing ConfigManager
   - No GUI framework dependencies in controllers

3. **Event-Driven Design Validated**
   - Callback registration pattern works well for loose coupling
   - Multiple callbacks per event supported
   - Easy to extend without modifying existing code

4. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Consistent `{success: bool, data/error: {...}}` pattern
   - Comprehensive try-catch blocks with logging
   - User-friendly error messages with technical details

#### Key Insights:

1. **tkinter Limitations Addressed**
   - Tree view checkboxes simulated with text symbols (✓/✗)
   - Tab interfaces work well as notebook widgets
   - Color theming more limited but acceptable

2. **Validation Importance**
   - JSON validation in AddServerDialog prevents invalid configs
   - Built-in preset protection in PresetController
   - Configuration validation before save operations

3. **User Experience Considerations**
   - Live validation provides immediate feedback
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
   - Status messages and progress indicators planned

#### Next Steps:
- **Immediate**: Implement event dispatcher system (T049)
- **Integration**: Connect controllers to main window (T050)

- Integration points clearly defined for future testing

## Testing Checklist

When making changes, verify:
1. Interactive mode (`mcp-config-manager interactive`) still works exactly as before
2. Backups are created before any config changes
3. Both Claude-only and Gemini-only modes function correctly
4. Sync between Claude and Gemini works when in 'both' mode
5. Error messages are clear when configs are missing or corrupted
6. Original `mcp_toggle.py` workflows remain supported
